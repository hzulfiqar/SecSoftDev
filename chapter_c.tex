\subsection{Cppcheck}
\textit{Cppcheck} is a very powerful analyzer for C and C++ which can find a lot different code issues. For example it tries to find out-of-bounds accesses, memory leaks or warn if obsolete or unsafe functions are used. Its main goal is to avoid false positives.

Cppcheck is easy to use and can be integrated in an continuous life cycle with very little effort.
Listing \ref{lst:cppcheck} shows how to run a Cppcheck analysis on C/C++ project. Cppcheck will examine any C/C++ file in the current folder and any folder below that (recursively) and create a XML summary file named \textit{cppcheck.xml}.

$ cppcheck --xml . 2> cppcheck.xml
